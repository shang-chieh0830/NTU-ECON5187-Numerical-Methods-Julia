    "## What's it and Why?\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- MSLE is an extension of MLE. It is often used in lieu of MLE when the likelihood function of the model cannot be derived analytically. In many cases, it happens when the model's density function involves an integral that cannot be expressed in closed form. We may call such a model _analytically intractable_. In this case, the likelihood function is approximated through simulation methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why we may care for analytically intractable models? Why not settle only for the tractable models?\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Analytically tractable models are easier to estimate, but the simplicity is often achieved through rigid behavioral assumptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - For instance, the stochastic frontier models are tractable if the distribution assumptions are \\{normal, truncated normal\\}, \\{normal, exponential\\}, etc.. However, the models become intractable for many other distribution combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - As another example, the multinomial logit model is tractable and easy to estimate, but it needs to impose the independence of irrelevant alternatives (IIA) assumption, which may not easy to justify. \n",
    "><p style=\"line-height:110%; font-size:92%;margin-left:10%\"> The IIA assumption states that the probability of choosing one alternative over another do not depend on the presence or absence of any other alternatives in the choice set. In other words, the relative preference between any two alternatives is independent of the attributes or existence of any other alternatives in the choice set. </p>\n",
    "  - Moreover, models with unobserved heterogeneity and/or  random effects often contain integrals that cannot be solved analytically.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - Therefore, if we want to relax the assumptions, we will have to use the MSLE to deal with the intractable models.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The basic idea of MSLE is to simulate data (generate a series of random draws, known as Monte Carlo draws, from predetermined distributions that represent the characteristics of the model) for the model based on a given set of parameters. The data is then used to construct and approximate the likelihood (i.e., the _simulated likelihood_) function in the estimation. When the parameters are changed in the optimization process, a different set of data is genereated and the model is estimated again. This process continues until the optimization process is done.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In a nutshell, MSLE replaces the integral with a numerically approximated integral.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - As we have learned, there are different methods of numerical integrations, including the quadrature method, the Monte Carlo (MC) method, and the quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) method. The term of \"MSLE\" is usually reserved for cases using the MC and QMC methods.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  - Nevertheless, the quadrature method could be used in dealing with the intractable likelihoods. At least for the one-dimensional integration problems, the quadrature method has superior performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- MSLE's asymptotic distribution is the same as MLE's if $S \\rightarrow \\infty$, $N \\rightarrow \\infty$, and $\\sqrt{N}/S \\rightarrow 0$ where $S$ is the number of simulation draws.\n",
