There are other types of weights. Regardless of the form, the weight function is often helpful in the numerical evaluation of the integral, and some important numerical methods are developed using the weight function.\n",

That's fine. We are often able to _assign_ a weight function to the problem (while making necessary adjustments) in order to take the advantage of the numerical methods. We will see such cases in the series of lectures."

We will use an example to demonstrate the claim. We should note, however, that **many (density) functions we are likely to encounter are not polynomials**, and therefore the result from applying the Gaussian rules remains an approximation.

    "### Which rule to use?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we mentioned earlier, to a large extent the decision depends on the type of problems at hand, but it should also be noted that **multiple rules could be applied to approximate the same problem** so there is a choice. Multiple rules could be applied (separately, of course) to approximate the same problem because very often we could use the change of variables to transform a given problem into different types, and thus different rules may apply. **Some rules are more \"general\" (e.g., the Gauss-Legendre)** in the sense that many integration problems can be easily transformed into a particular type, and thus the rules apply. The ease-of-use makes the rule a good candidate for developing a general-purpose computer program that accepts all types of integration problems, makes a suitable transformation via a change of variables, and applies the Gaussian rules to do the approximation. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, the generality may come at the expense of efficiency: **If the integration problem is of a particular type, directly applying the type's rule is often more efficient (same precision with a smaller $n$)**. For example, if the integration problem involves density functions of normal or log-normal random variables, the Gauss-Hermite rule is more efficient. If the problem involves density functions of exponential, Chi-square, or Gamma distributions, the Gauss-Laguerre rule is more efficient. So if we have a particular problem at hand that requires efficiency (*faster*), we may want to use a program (or write our own programs) that is tailored to the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We elaborate the view in the follows. First, let's recall the definition of _**proper integrals**_:\n",
    "    \n",
    ">A **proper integral** is a _**definite integral**_ whose integrand is _**continuous over the bounded domain of integration**_. Other integrals are considered improper integrals. For example, \n",

    "Among the Gaussian rules, the Gauss-Legendre (GL) rule is the most commonly used. It deals with proper integrals, and the simple weight function ($p(x)=1$) makes it easy to apply to all types of integrands (any integrands can be treated as having $p(x)=1$). The only requirement is that we need the domain in $[-1,1]$ in order to apply the GL rule. In fact, all sorts of domains ($[a, b]$, $[-\\infty, \\infty]$, $[a, \\infty]$, $[-\\infty, b]$ with $a$ and $b$ being finite numbers) can be transformed into $[-1,1]$ using a change of variables with some pre-defined formula. For example:\n",

    "$$[a, \\infty]$$       | $$x = a + \\frac{1+t}{1-t}$$    | $$[-1,1]$$ | $$\\frac{2}{(t-1)^2}$$\n",
    "$$[-\\infty, b]$$      | $$x = b - \\frac{1-t}{1+t}$$    | $$[-1,1]$$ | $$\\frac{2}{(t+1)^2}$$\n",

    "`quadgk()`). \n",
    "\n",
    "One thing to consider, however, is whether the GL rule provides the most efficient algorithm (same precision with a smaller $n$) for your problems.

The followings are some general observations.\n",
    " - If the problem's domain and weight function fit exactly the GH, GLa, or other types, use the rule of the type to gain efficiency.\n",
    " - If the problem's domain is $[-\\infty, \\infty]$ and it has an exponential function in the integrand, there is a good chance that you can do a change of variables to transform the exponential function to the weight function of the GH type *while leaving the domain unchanged*. Then the GH rule can be applied. For instance, $\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp(-\\frac{1}{3}x^2)g(x) dx$.\n",

    "## Adaptive Quadratures\n",
    "\n",
    "Adaptive quadrature is also a quadrature-based integration method. It approximates the integral of a given function recursively until the result meets a pre-specified precision, the latter of which is given by choosing a tolerance for the integration error. If the approximation results in an error larger than the tolerance, the domain is divided into two equal sub-regions, and the same number of quadrature points is applied again within each of the sub regions. If the result still has a larger error, then a subdivision is applied to that sub region once more. The process continues until the approximation error is smaller than the chosen tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of the recursive process is that the approximation error would be large if there are not enough quadrature points to approximate the integral. The problem is most likely to occur in regions where the function is steep or has large variations. Intuitively, more points would be required to evaluate such a region where only a few nodes may be enough for other regions with gentle variations. By dividing the domain into smaller segments and applying the quadrature rules to each one of them, we achieve two things: (1) Each of the smaller pieces may become more smoothed and well-behaved within itself and so it can be better approximated for a polynomial of a fixed degree, and (2) more points are used to approximate the region.\n",

    "A key element in the adaptive quadrature is the error estimation. Apparently, the error is not in relation to the true value of integral since the latter is unknown. Instead, the error is usually measured by the absolute value of the difference between two different rules or between results of different numbers of nodes. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, for the *adaptive Trapezoidal method* and the *adaptive Simpson's method*, we could use $| I^T(n) - I^T(n/2) | < 3 \\epsilon$ or $| I^S(n) - I^S(n/2) | < 15 \\epsilon$, respectively, as the stopping rules, where $I^T(n)$ and $I^S(n)$ represent integration results from the $n$-node trapezoidal and the Simpson's rules, and $\\epsilon$ is the specified precision. \n",

In Section 2 we discuss how to scale different error estimates by using the weights of null (Practical error estimation in adaptive multidimensional quadrature routines, Jarle BERNTSEN)\"\n",
